#Dummy .eu4 php parser

Parse eu4 structure to php array. Values with same keys converts to array of values. Links becomes strings. By reasons all values become strings, so you can convert them to any type you need.

Performance are fine as for php. With 4700HQ takes about 6 seconds per 40MB file. But about 450MB of RAM :Trollface:
